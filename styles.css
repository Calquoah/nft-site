/* General CSS */

/* 
Challenge:
1. Refactor the CSS to make it DRYer
   by grouping selectors together where
   possible.

/* Something to note:

When an element touches its parent, its
top and bottom margins will merge with the 
margins of the parent element 

What's the Solution to this problem?

To add padding to the parent element

*/

/* 
Challenge:
1. Create a "section" selector and give it the 
   same padding as the header.
2. In index.html, find the image of the purple 
   sneakers and attach a class to it. 
3. Make it so this image takes up 100% 
   of the section width.

/* Typography */

/* 
Challenge:
1. Add CSS so the text in the first section 
   renders correctly. 
⚠️ Watch out for the amount of white space 
   you have between the start of the section 
   and the h2.
⚠️ Don't write too much code!

    taken care of that for you

}*/

/* 
Challenge:
1. Set the color of the link in the paragraph.
2. Make the link color change on hover and 
   active states.
3. Search online to find out how you can give

Challenge:
1. Give the images in section two a class.
2. Use that class to set the width and 
   border-radius for the images.
3. Wrap the two images in a container div

4. Create the CSS selector for that class 
   and use flex-box to layout the images
