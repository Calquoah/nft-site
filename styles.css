When an element touches its parent, its
top and bottom margins will merge with the 
margins of the parent element 

What's the Solution to this problem?

To add padding to the parent element

Challenge:
1. Create a "section" selector and give it the

2. In index.html, find the image of the purple 
   sneakers and attach a class to it. 
3. Make it so this image takes up 100% 
   of the section width.

Challenge:
1. Add CSS so the text in the first section
